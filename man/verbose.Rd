\title{Verbose levels, defining verboseness of messages}
\format{
An object of class \code{NULL} of length 0.
}
\usage{
verbose
}
\description{
There are several levels of verboseness one can choose from.

\strong{levels:}

\itemize{
	\item level 0 is almost silent, producing only necessary messages 
	\item level 1 is good for most purposes, where as, 
	\item level 2 is good when developing a new pipeline.
	\item level 3 is good for debugging, especially when getting un-expected results.
}
	
	One can set the level of verboseness using \code{opts_flow$set(verbose=2)}, which 
	will be used across flowr and ngsflows packages. Additionally one may set this value in 
	the configurations files: \code{~/flowr/conf/flowr.conf} OR \code{~/flowr/conf/ngsflows.conf}.
}
\examples{
fl = system.file("pipelines/abcd.def", package = "flowr")
def = as.flowdef(fl, verbose = 0)
# def seems to be a file, reading it...
def = as.flowdef(fl, verbose = 1)
