flow
===============

:func:`flow`

Flow constructor

Usage
""""""""""""""""""
::

 flow(jobs = list(new("job")), name = "newflow", desc = "my_super_flow", mode = c("scheduler", "trigger", "R"), flow_base_path = "~/flowr", trigger_path = "", flow_path = "", status = "")

Arguments

jobs
    ``list`` A list of jobs to be included in this flow
name
    ``character`` Name of the flow. Defaults to ``'newname'``
Used in `submit_flow <http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/flow/docs/submit_flow-flow-method>`_ to name the working directories.
desc
    ``character`` Description of the flow
This is used to name folders (when submitting jobs, see `submit_flow <http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/flow/docs/submit_flow-flow-method>`_).
It is good practice to avoid spaces and other special characters.
An underscore '_' seems like a good word separator.
Defaults to 'my_super_flow'. We usually use this to put sample names of the data.
mode
    ``character`` Mode of submission of the flow.
flow_base_path
    The base path of all the flows you would submit.
Defaults to ``~/flows``. Best practice to ignore it.
trigger_path
    ``character``
Defaults to ``~/flows/trigger``. Best practice to ignore it.
flow_path
    ``character``
status
    ``character`` Not used at this time

Examples
""""""""""""""""""
::

 cmds = rep("sleep 5", 10)
 qobj <- queue(type='torque')
 **Setting default time to: 72:00:00. If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail. You may change this in job()
 ****Setting default memory to: 10g. If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail.
 **## run the 10 commands in parallel
 jobj1 <- job(q_obj=qobj, cmd = cmds, submission_type = "scatter", name = "job1")
 
 ## run the 10 commands sequentially, but WAIT for the previous job to complete
 ## Many-To-One
 jobj2 <- job(q_obj=qobj, cmd = cmds, submission_type = "serial",
  dependency_type = "gather", previous_job = "job1", name = "job2")
 
 ## As soon as first job on 'job1' is complete
 ## One-To-One
 jobj3 <- job(q_obj=qobj, cmd = cmds, submission_type = "scatter",
  dependency_type = "serial", previous_job = "job1", name = "job3")
 
 fobj <- flow(jobs = list(jobj1, jobj2, jobj3))
 
 ## plot the flow
 plot_flow(fobj)
 ## **Not run**: 
 # ## dry run, only create the structure without submitting jobs
 # submit_flow(fobj)
 # 
 # ## execute the jobs: ONLY works on computing cluster, would fail otherwise
 # submit_flow(fobj, execute = TRUE)
 # ## **End(Not run)**
