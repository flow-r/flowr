job
===============

:func:`job`

job class

Usage
""""""""""""""""""
::

 job(cmds = "", name = "myjob", q_obj = new("queue"), previous_job = "", cpu = 1, memory, walltime, submission_type = c("scatter", "serial"), dependency_type = c("none", "gather", "serial", "burst"), ...)

Arguments

cmds
    the commands to run
name
    name of the job
q_obj
    queue object
previous_job
    character vector of previous job. If this is the first job, one can leave this empty, NA, NULL, '.', or ''. In future this could specify multiple previous jobs.
cpu
    no of cpu's reserved
memory
    The amount of memory reserved. Units depend on the platform used to process jobs
walltime
    The amount of time reserved for this job. Format is unique to a platform. Typically it looks like 12:00 (12 hours reserved, say in LSF), in Torque etc. we often see measuring in seconds: 12:00:00
submission_type
    submission type: A character with values: scatter, serial. Scatter means all the 'cmds' would be run in parallel as seperate jobs. Serial, they would combined into a single job and run one-by-one.
dependency_type
    depedency type. One of none, gather, serial, burst. If previous_job is specified, then this would not be 'none'. [Required]
...
    other passed onto object creation. Example: memory, walltime, cpu
status
    status [ignore]. this is used internally to update status of the job.

Examples
""""""""""""""""""
::

 qobj <- queue(type="torque")
 **Setting default time to: 72:00:00. If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail. You may change this in job()
 ****Setting default memory to: 10g. If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail.
 **
 ## torque job with 1 CPU running command 'sleep 2'
 j_obj <- job(q_obj=qobj, cmd = "sleep 2", cpu=1)
 
 ## multiple commands
 cmds = rep("sleep 5", 10)
 
 ## run the 10 commands in parallel
 jobj1 <- job(q_obj=qobj, cmd = cmds, submission_type = "scatter", name = "job1")
 
 ## run the 10 commands sequentially, but WAIT for the previous job to complete
 jobj2 <- job(q_obj=qobj, cmd = cmds, submission_type = "serial",
    dependency_type = "gather", previous_job = "job1")
 
 fobj <- flow(jobs = list(jobj1, jobj2))
 
 ## plot the flow
 plot_flow(fobj)

 # ## execute the jobs: ONLY works on computing cluster, would fail otherwise
